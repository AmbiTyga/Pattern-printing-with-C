## 🧐 What's inside?

1.  **`Individual patterns`**: This directory contains all the individual patterns.
2.  **`Main.c`**: This file contains a code combined of all the patterns.

**`Note`**: There is no relation between **`Individual patterns`** directory and **`Main.c`**.

Adding code directly to Main.c file is little tedious for beginners that's why created separate files for each pattern.
